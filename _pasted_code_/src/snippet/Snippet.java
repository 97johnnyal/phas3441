public class Snippet {
	Commercial's primary purpose is to deliver value for money and a quality service to the DfT, and hence the public. This is achieved by analysing contracts to identify cost savings and opportunities for negotiation with external stakeholders, efficient management and delivery of complex projects, and managing relationships with the public (such as managing objections from Euston residents to the delivery of HS2).
	I appreciate that the CDP offers a chance to use my Physics degree in a practical way. Identifying areas to save the public money and determine the best supplier for a given contract seems like a great balance of the numerical and analytic aspects of my degree and day-to-day impacts on people's lives.
	I also want to use my communication and leadership skills (developed teaching competitive debating), both in negotiations with stakeholders and in public relations. DfT responsibilities such as commuters' journeys make a huge difference in people's lives, so being able to improve return on public investment through negotiations, or to advocate for environmental goals such as emission reduction, is exciting for me. I also appreciate the leadership development opportunities offered by the Programme.
	Finally, I thrive under pressure, and am excited by the opportunity to manage important projects early on in my career while knowing I am supported by the Department's mentoring scheme. I also appreciate the CPD opportunities available, especially the Association for Project Management qualification, as I value pushing myself forward professionally to be more useful as a Civil Servant.
